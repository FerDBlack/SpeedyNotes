# SpeedyNotes
Greetings to all.

My name is Fernando Grandos Ju√°rez.

I am a developer looking to practice and improve his knowledge about Angular and .NET. I've always wanted to have my own tool to take notes and be able to add and remove the features I want. From this idea was born Speedy Notes, an application in which I can modify and take notes as I like.


Thank you for your time.
